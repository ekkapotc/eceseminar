# Regression and Neural Network Examples in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations demonstrating how derivatives can be applied to solve simple regression problems and neural network tasks.

## Included Examples

1. **Linear Regression**  
   - Solves the classic linear regression problem `y = mx + c` using derivatives to optimize the model parameters.

2. **Logic Gates with Neural Networks**  
   - Implements basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) using a simple neural network approach.

## Features

- Step-by-step implementation of derivative-based optimization.
- Clear, educational examples suitable for learning and experimentation.
- Lightweight C++ code with minimal dependencies.
